puebe
=======


The skycoin client binary uses a localhost http interface for its GUI.
By default it runs on http://127.0.0.1:9000.  This is configurable with

    --web-interface-port
    --web-interface-addr

To see a list of all options, use the -h flag.

The puebe.run script starts the puebe client binary and opens the interface in the
browser with xdg-open. It is not aware of any changes to puebe client's web 
interface configuration, you can override the url with PUEBE_WEB_URL or by 
editing the puebe.url file.

If there is no webpage available, try reloading the page. The page may have opened
before the puebe client finished loading.
